                </h1>

                    <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Charlotte-Perkins-Gilman"> Charlotte Perkins Gilman (1860-1935)</a>
                    
                    was a pioneering American writer, lecturer, and advocate for women's rights, 
                    best known for her influential works in feminism and economics during late nineteenth and early twentieth century.
                    Despite limited formal education and a complicated relationship with her family, Gilman often referred to herself as an autodidact: she became a self-taught scholar 
                    and prolific writer.

                    Her groundbreaking essay, the psychological thriller "The Yellow Wallpaper," highlighted the oppressive nature of women's domestic roles and exposed deliberate medical and social misinterpretations of women.
                    In her landmark book, "Women and Economics," she dissected the economic subjugation of women and argued for the financial independence of women as a primary avenue to equal enfranchisement.

                    Gilman's ideas particularly gained traction during the Progressive Era, impacting social and political discourse surrounding "the woman question." 
                    As a travelling lecturer and scholar, she actively engaged in public speaking, championing feminist causes, and advocating for social and legal reforms. 
                    Her work greatly influenced prominent figures of the time, including Theodore Roosevelt and Jane Addams. Gilman's unwavering commitment to dismantling gender norms and economic disparities particularly resonated with the Progressive Era and contributed to the suffragist struggle for women's rights.
