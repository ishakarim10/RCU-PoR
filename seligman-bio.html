                    <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Edwin-Robert-Anderson-Seligman"> Edwin R.A. Seligman (1861-1939)</a>
                    
         
                    was a distinguished American economist and professor noted for his significant economic contributions during his tenure at Columbia University. 
                    As a professor there, he played a pivotal role in shaping economic thought and policy in the United States. His
                    most enduring legacy lies in his construction of the graduated income tax in the United States. 
                    His book, "The Income Tax: A Study of the History, Theory, and 
                    Practice of Income Taxation at Home and Abroad," became a seminal work on the subject.

                    Beyond his academic pursuits, Seligman's global influence extended to his association with B.R. Ambedkar, 
                    then his economics student at Columbia. Ambedkar was 
                    profoundly influenced by Seligman's ideas on financial reform and related economic policy. Their relationship 
                    reflected Seligman's impact within domestic academic circles and the international realm, as his ideas for the United States
                    contributed to transformative and radical reforms internationally that revolutionized global economic policy.
