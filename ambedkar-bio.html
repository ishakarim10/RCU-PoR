                <h1 class="animated-text"> B.R. Ambedkar: Political Economist, Radical Social Reformer, Sociologist
                </h1>
                <p>
                    
                    <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Bhimrao-Ramji-Ambedkar">B.R. Ambedkar (1891-1956)</a>
                    
                    was a visionary Indian jurist, social reformer, and the chief author of the Indian Constitution. After graduating from the University of 
                    Bombay, Ambedkar later pursued advanced studies in economics at Columbia University. 
                    There, he was profoundly influenced by <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/John-Dewey">John Dewey</a>, a 
                    Pragmatist philosopher, who became a mentor and profoundly shaped Ambedkar's intellectual development.

                    In further studies after Columbia, Ambedkar studied at the London School of Economics, earning another doctorate in 
                    economics. His multifaceted contributions spanned law, economics, and sociology, culminating in his pivotal role as the 
                    chairman of the drafting committee for the Indian Constitution. A prolific thinker and correspondent, Ambedkar was very well 
                    connected internationally via correspondence and closely maintained these relationships.
                    
                    Ambedkar's seminal works, including "Castes in India," "Annihilation of Caste," and "Buddha or Karl Marx," 
                    critiqued the entrenchment of the caste system in India, 
                    as Ambedkarites continue to advocate for its abolition as Ambedkar did during his life. 
                    His advocacy and political reform work for the social and political enfranchisement of the Dalit 
                    and marginalized communities fundementally shaped the discourse on social 
                    reform in India and continues to do so today. Ambedkar's legacy endures as a international beacon of social 
                    equality and justice, influencing movements globally and forging solidarities with Black enfrachisment movements in the United States.
                    At the close of his life, 
                    Ambedkar remained a radical thinker as he publicly renounced Hinduism and converted to Buddhism.
