                <h1 class="animated-text"> John Maynard Keynes: British Economist
                </h1>
                <p>
                    
                    <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/John-Maynard-Keynes">John Maynard Keynes (1883-1946)</a>
                    
                    revolutionized economic thought during the 20th century as a British economist. 
                    Keynes played a pivotal role in shaping a modern macroeconomic theory that persists today. His 
                    influential work includes "The Economic Consequences of the Peace," an economic critique the Treaty of Versailles after World War I.

                    Keynes' international contributions occur in the context of his time as a colonial administrator, from which he authored "Indian Currency 
                    and Finance," a treatise that addressed colonial India's monetary challenges and proposed certain reforms. These experiences laid the foundation for Keynes' later theories, notably "The 
                    General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money," which laid the groundwork for what came to be considered "Keynesian economics." 
                    Although an intellectual of much critique, Keynes was a 
                    transformative figure in economic history, with his ideas influencing domestic policies in the United States and shaping the global economic landscape in the 20th century.
