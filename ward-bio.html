                </h1>
                <p>
                    
                    <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Lester-Frank-Ward">Lester Frank Ward (1841-1913)</a>

                    , a Reform Darwinist, was an early American sociologist who criticized  “unitary assumptions” of social 
                    Darwinism and laissez-faire individualism. (Hofstadter 68). Like Ambedkar for India, Ward advocated for a 
                    <span class="bannotate">planned society</span> and was among the first Americans to “interpret” European thought on state intervention 
                    (Hofstadter 81). 

                    Against Gilded Age's naturalization of inequality at the close of Reconstruction Era, Ward both empircally and theoretically argued that 
                    poverty can and should be ameliorated
                    by systematic <span class="bannotate"> state intervention.</span> 

                    Ward's most important book, <i>Dynamic Sociology</i> (1883), emphasized the importance of education for social equality. He believed in a sociology that could direct and guide progressive social and economic development,
                    and in its study establish holistic educational systems that could regulate competition and secure equal opportunity and social cooperation. 
                   
                    Ward writes his <span class="bannotate">Gynaecocentric Theory</span> suggesting that the female sex is originally  <span class="bannotate">primary</span> and the male is 
                    secondary in the  <span class="bannotate">"organic scheme."</span> The current androcentric model is 
                    thus an artificial and (intended to be) permanent reordering of the natural scheme.

                    <i>Connection to Problem of the Rupee:</i> Ambedkar argues that the exchange rate is artificially manipulated to perpetually devalue the rupee 
                    against the sterling: as such, <i>Problem of the Rupee</i> participates in broader questions of (artificially distorted) exchange & 
                    exchange rates.
